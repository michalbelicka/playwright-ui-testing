# Playwright UI Testing

UI test automation project built with **Python, Playwright and pytest**.

The project focuses on automated testing of the [Automation Exercise](https://www.automationexercise.com/) e-commerce website and demonstrates practical use of **Page Object Model (POM)**, pytest fixtures, reusable test methods and automated test execution with **GitHub Actions**.

## Tech Stack

- Python
- Playwright
- pytest
- Page Object Model (POM)
- GitHub Actions
- Git / GitHub

## Test Coverage

The current UI test suite covers:

- User registration and account deletion
- Valid and invalid login
- Logout
- Adding and removing products from the cart
- Product quantity
- Product search
- Product details

## Test Design

The project uses the **Page Object Model (POM)** to separate test logic from page-specific interactions.

Reusable pytest fixtures are used to prepare common test states, such as:

- Opening the website and handling the cookie banner
- Logging in
- Starting with an empty shopping cart

This keeps the test cases focused on the behavior being verified while reducing duplicated setup code.

## CI/CD

Tests are integrated with **GitHub Actions** and are automatically executed:

- On every push
- On pull requests
- On a scheduled daily run

The workflow:

1. Sets up Python
2. Installs project dependencies
3. Installs Playwright browsers
4. Runs code quality checks
5. Executes the automated test suite

## Future Improvements

- Add API test coverage using Playwright APIRequestContext
- Expand UI test coverage
- Add more advanced test scenarios
